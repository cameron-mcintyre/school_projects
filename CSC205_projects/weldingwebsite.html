	<h1><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h1>
	<h3>24SB-CSC200-1, C McIntyre</h3>
	<p>Fluxcore welders are very easy to use for a beginner.  There are a variety of reasons that a person would benefit from the purchase and aquaintance with an inexpensive fluxcore welder.  On this site, some of the basic advantages and disadvantages of fluxcore welders will be discussed, along with some tips concerning the purchase and use of this tool</p>

	<h2><b><u>Advantages of owning a small welder</u></b></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You can make small repairs around the house to metal objects</li>
		<li>You can make more complex car repairs</li>
		<li>When you weld things together, you can create very strong items.</li>
		<li>The cost of entry is pretty low, especially if you have a nearby garbage dump that lets you pick scrap metal for free</li>
		<li><b>Welding for fun is very satisfying!</b></li>
	</ul>

	<h2><b><u>Purchasing a flux core welder</u></b></h2>
	<p>If you haven't used a welder before, begin by purchasing a very small flux core model from a cheap tool store such as Harbor Freight Tools.  This should cost somewhere around $150.  It is recommended that you purchase a welding hood that is more high end, because the welding hood is a safety device that will protect your vision.  A reasonable quality autodarkening welding hood from HFT will cost around $80.</p>

	<p>There are many types of welders.  Flux core welders are easiest to start and learn on, because the core of the metal wire contains the flux.  Flux is a material that turns into a gas that surrounds the weld as you are welding.  This is crucial because a fresh weld needs to avoid exposure to oxygen in the air, lest the oxygen oxidize the weld and weaken it.  Other welders use other methods of encasing the weld in an inert gas.  MIG welders, for instance, have a gas bottle that flows gas into a fresh weld.  This additional item adds cost and complexity that aren't present in a flux core welder, but the gas delivery in a MIG system is cleaner and the welds from such a tool are of higher quality.</p>

	<h2><b><u>Tips for Using Your Small Welder</u></b></h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Make sure to equip your safety equipment!  Welding hood, gloves, and full set of clothing with closed toed shoes.</li>
		<li>Follow the manual to ensure you're using the correct power settings.  More power to your welding tip means your weld will penetrate deeper into the metal.</li>
		<li>Start practicing with 4mm thick steel.  This is a good thickness that will allow you to learn without burning through too quickly</li>
		<li>Make sure your welding hood is set to the correct brightness, and make sure you have plenty of environmental light in the area you are welding.  Bad lighting = bad welds!</li>
		<li>Don't worry if your welds are messy.  Until you practice quite a bit, your welding will be ugly in appearance.  Use a grinder to clean up your welds when finished.</li>
